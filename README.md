## Project Overview

Building a state-of-the-art image classification application using pre-trained deep convolutional networks. 
- In the first part, they develop the code in a Jupyter notebook.
- In the second part, they convert their code into a command line application. This project is designed to demonstrate students' skills with Python, deep learning, and PyTorch.  


Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, you will make important design decisions about the user experience for your app.  Our goal is that by completing this lab, you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!
